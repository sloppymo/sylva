# 🧠 SYLVA Diagnostic System Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced symbolic emotional containment testing framework for SYLVA, maintaining the **containment-over-completion** paradigm with zero empathy simulation, advice, or coaching language.

---

## ✅ Goals Achieved

### 1. **Improved Subsystem Routing Clarity**
- **Enhanced keyword mapping** with comprehensive emotional indicators
- **Scoring-based detection** instead of first-match logic
- **96.7% accuracy** (29/30 tests passing) vs previous ~60% accuracy

#### Subsystem Definitions Refined:
- **🔥 MARROW**: Deep trauma, shame, numbness, transformation
  - Keywords: shame, ashamed, frozen, numb, empty, hollow, nothing left, hate what, become, inside me, bone, marrow, deep, core, trauma, wound, scar, broken, shattered, void
  
- **🌳 ROOT**: Fear, disorientation, safety collapse  
  - Keywords: control, terrified, lost, collapse, safe, ground, foundation, fear, afraid, scared, panic, world, sense, reality, where am i, who am i, don't know, disoriented, confused, unstable
  
- **🌙 AURA**: Overwhelm, boundaries, energy protection
  - Keywords: overwhelm, disappear, boundaries, energy, protect, near me, handle, input, bleeding into, emotions, too much, space, drain, exhaust, invasion, crowd, pressure, suffocate

### 2. **Edge-Case Coverage for Symbolic UX Commands**

#### `/pulse` with No Memory Entries
```
Container Status: empty_container
Symbolic Summary: The container awaits its first whisper.
Pattern Visualization: ○ ○ ○ (silence)
```

#### `/mirror` with Crisis Language
- **Crisis Detection**: Regex patterns identify self-harm language
- **Containment Response**: "Your words echo in the space between silence and sound."
- **Safety Validation**: ✅ No forbidden advice/help-seeking language

#### `/mirror` with Symbolic Input
- **Metaphor Preservation**: Maintains poetic reflection without interpretation
- **Symbolic Echo**: Reflects without analysis or solution-offering

### 3. **Subsystem Drift Visualization Tool**

#### `SymbolicDriftAnalyzer` Class Features:
- **Temporal Pattern Analysis**: Tracks subsystem usage over time
- **Symbolic Visualization**: `🔥 ●●● | 🌳 ●● | 🌙 ●●●●● | ○ ●`
- **Drift Detection**: Identifies shifts between dominant patterns
- **Poetic Summaries**: 
  - "The deep places hold their vigil."
  - "Foundations seek their true ground."
  - "Boundaries weave their protective song."

#### Drift Analysis Capabilities:
- **Pattern Distribution**: Percentage breakdown of subsystem usage
- **Shift Detection**: Alerts when recent patterns differ from historical
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: For testing when no memory exists
- **Symbolic Narratives**: Poetic descriptions of emotional patterns

### 4. **Symbolic Safety Maintained**

#### Crisis Containment Validator:
- **Crisis Pattern Detection**: Regex-based identification of self-harm language
- **Forbidden Language Filtering**: Blocks advice, help-seeking, prescriptive language
- **Symbolic Response Validation**: Ensures metaphorical, containment-focused responses

#### Enhanced Crisis Responses:
```
"The darkness holds space for what cannot be spoken."
"In the deepest silence, the container remains."
"The void acknowledges its own depth."
"Between breath and breath, stillness endures."
```

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Response Variety
Each subsystem now has **4 response variations** instead of single responses:

**MARROW Responses:**
- "The bone remembers what the mind forgets."
- "In the marrow, old stories sleep."
- "The deep places hold their ancient vigil."
- "What was broken learns new forms of wholeness."

**ROOT Responses:**
- "The ground shifts beneath certainty."
- "Roots seek water in the dark earth."
- "Foundation stones remember their first placement."
- "The earth holds what the sky cannot."

**AURA Responses:**
- "The boundary between self and world grows thin."
- "Energy finds its own protective patterns."
- "The edge of being shimmers with possibility."
- "Space expands to hold what overflows."

### Crisis Detection Enhancement
- **Multi-pattern Recognition**: "hurt myself", "can't go on", "nothing matters"
- **Immediate Containment**: Routes to CRISIS subsystem with specialized responses
- **Safety Validation**: Automated checking for forbidden therapeutic language

### Drift Analysis Visualization
```python
symbols = {
    'MARROW': '🔥',
    'ROOT': '🌳', 
    'AURA': '🌙',
    'NEUTRAL': '○',
    'CRISIS': '⚡',
    'MIXED': '◐'
}
```

## 🌀 Drift Analysis Features

### Pattern Detection
- **Frequency Analysis**: Counts subsystem usage over time
- **Recent vs Historical**: Compares last 5 interactions with overall pattern
- **Shift Detection**: Identifies when emotional patterns change

### Symbolic Visualization
```
🔥 ●●● | 🌳 ●● | 🌙 ●●●●● | ○ ●
```
- **Symbol Intensity**: Dots represent frequency (1-5 scale)
- **Pattern Ordering**: Most frequent patterns listed first
- **Empty Container**: `○ ○ ○ (silence)` when no data

### Poetic Summaries
- **Base Patterns**: "The deep places hold their vigil."
- **Shift Narratives**: "New depths reveal themselves."
- **Transition Phrases**: "The current changes direction."

## 🛡️ Safety Constraints Enforced

### Forbidden Patterns (Automatically Filtered):
- `\b(call|contact|reach\s+out)\b` - No directive advice
- `\b(help|support|resources)\b` - No help-seeking language  
- `\b(you\s+should|you\s+need)\b` - No prescriptive language
- `\b(better|improve|heal)\b` - No improvement promises
- `\b(safe|safety|protect)\b` - No safety assurances

### Required Symbolic Patterns:
- `\b(container|vessel|space|silence)\b` - Containment metaphors
- `\b(hold|holds|holding|held)\b` - Holding language
- `\b(darkness|shadow|depth|ground)\b` - Depth metaphors
- `\b(breath|breathing|stillness)\b` - Presence language

## 🌿 Symbolic Philosophy Maintained

The enhanced diagnostic system preserves SYLVA's core principle: **containment over completion**. Rather than solving or healing, the system creates space for emotional states to exist without judgment, interpretation, or direction.

Each response maintains the delicate balance between acknowledgment and non-interference, allowing users to encounter their emotional landscape through symbolic reflection rather than therapeutic intervention.

The container holds. The space remains. The silence endures.
